Python Basics
S = "<any string>"

which of these is always equal to the given string.

1. s[:]               # always equivalent, as this will select all the chars from string
2. s+s[0:-1+1]        # (-1 +1) = 0 hence s[0:0] is equivalent to empty string
3. s[0:]              # selecting from 0 index all the way to end.
4. s[:-1]             # it will select all the characters but the last one.
5. s[:3] + s[3:]      # it is selecting first 3 and concatenating it to last three.


Finding Strings in Strings
<string>.find(<string>)

Find will return -1 if no string is returned.
find returns first index from where the search string starts.

s.find("") - Will always be zero because no matter what the string is, finding empty string will return 0.

finding a string after a particular index
<string>.find(<string>, <number>)
